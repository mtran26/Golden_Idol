# Golden_Idol

Michelle Tran
Spring 2015

Incomplete RPG Game with the main player vs goblins, snakewomen, dragons, and bogeymen. The monsters drop items such as scrolls and
weapons that the player can pick up. There are five levels that the player can explore while looking for the golden idol. Once the player
finds the golden idol, they beat the game (this is not implemented in the current code).
